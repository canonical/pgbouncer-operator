# PgBouncer Documentation

The PgBouncer Operator delivers automated operations management from day 0 to day 2 on the [PgBouncer](http://www.pgbouncer.org/) - the  lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL. It is an open source, end-to-end, production-ready data platform on top of [Juju](https://juju.is/).

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. Consider to use [Charmed PostgreSQL](https://charmhub.io/postgresql).

The PgBouncer operator comes in two flavours to deploy and operate PostgreSQL on [physical/virtual machines](https://github.com/canonical/pgbouncer-operator) and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/canonical/pgbouncer-operator). Both offer identical features and simplifies deployment, scaling, configuration and management of PgBouncer in production at scale in a reliable way.
