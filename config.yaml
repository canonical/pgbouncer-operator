  listen_addr:
    default: "*"
    description: |
      Specifies a list (comma-separated) of addresses where to listen for TCP
      connections. You may also use * meaning “listen on all addresses”. When
      not set, only Unix socket connections are accepted.

      Addresses can be specified numerically (IPv4/IPv6) or by name.

  pool_mode:
    default: session
    description: |
      Specifies when a server connection can be reused by other clients. Can
      be one of the following values:

      session
      Server is released back to pool after client disconnects. Default.

      transaction
      Server is released back to pool after transaction finishes.

      statement
      Server is released back to pool after query finishes. Transactions
      spanning multiple statements are disallowed in this mode.
    type: string

  max_client_conn:
    default: 100
    description: |
      Maximum number of client connections allowed.

      When this setting is increased, then the file descriptor limits in the
      operating system might also have to be increased. Note that the number of
      file descriptors potentially used is more than max_client_conn. If each
      user connects under its own user name to the server, the theoretical
      maximum used is:

      max_client_conn + (max pool_size * total databases * total users)

      If a database user is specified in the connection string (all users
      connect under the same user name), the theoretical maximum is:

      max_client_conn + (max pool_size * total databases)

      The theoretical maximum should never be reached, unless somebody
      deliberately crafts a special load for it. Still, it means you should set
      the number of file descriptors to a safely high number.

      This can also be set per database in the [databases] section.

      Note that when you hit the limit, closing a client connection to one pool
      will not immediately allow a server connection to be established for
      another pool, because the server connection for the first pool is still
      open. Once the server connection closes (due to idle timeout), a new

      This can also be set per user in the [users] section.

      Note that when you hit the limit, closing a client connection to one pool
      will not immediately allow a server connection to be established for

      By default, PgBouncer reuses server connections in LIFO (last-in,

      best performance if you have a single server serving a database. But if
      there is a round-robin system behind a database address (TCP, DNS, or
      host list), then it is better if PgBouncer also uses connections in that
      manner, thus achieving uniform load.

  # Authentication Settings
  auth_type:
    default: md5
    description: |
      How to authenticate users.

      cert
      Client must connect over TLS connection with a valid client certificate.
      The user name is then taken from the CommonName field from the
      certificate.

      md5
      Use MD5-based password check. This is the default authentication method.
      auth_file may contain both MD5-encrypted and plain-text passwords. If md5
      is configured and a user has a SCRAM secret, then SCRAM authentication is
      used automatically instead.

      scram-sha-256
      Use password check with SCRAM-SHA-256. auth_file has to contain SCRAM
      secrets or plain-text passwords.

      plain
      The clear-text password is sent over the wire. Deprecated.

      trust
      No authentication is done. The user name must still exist in auth_file.
      any
      Like the trust method, but the user name given is ignored. Requires that
      all databases are configured to log in as a specific user. Additionally,
      the console database allows any user to log in as admin.

      hba
      The actual authentication type is loaded from auth_hba_file. This allows
      different authentication methods for different access paths, for example:
      connections over Unix socket use the peer auth method, connections over
      TCP must use TLS.

      pam
      PAM is used to authenticate users, auth_file is ignored. This method is
      not compatible with databases using the auth_user option. The service
      name reported to PAM is “pgbouncer”. pam is not supported in the HBA
      configuration file.
    type: string

  auth_user:
    description: |
      If auth_user is set, then any user not specified in auth_file will be
      queried through the auth_query query from pg_shadow in the database,
      using auth_user. The password of auth_user will be taken from auth_file.
      (If the auth_user does not require a password then it does not need to be
      defined in auth_file.)

      Direct access to pg_shadow requires admin rights. It’s preferable to use
      a non-superuser that calls a SECURITY DEFINER function instead.

  server_reset_query_always:

      Whether server_reset_query should be run in all pooling modes. When this
      setting is off (default), the server_reset_query will be run only in
      pools that are in sessions-pooling mode. Connections in
      transaction-pooling mode should not have any need for a reset query.

      This setting is for working around broken setups that run applications
      that use session features over a transaction-pooled PgBouncer. It changes
      non-deterministic breakage to deterministic breakage: Clients always lose
      their state after each transaction.
    type: int

  server_check_delay:
    default: 30.0
    description: |

  server_fast_close:
    default: 0
    description: |
      Disconnect a server in session pooling mode immediately or after the end
      of the current transaction if it is in “close_needed” mode (set by
      RECONNECT, RELOAD that changes connection settings, or DNS change),
      rather than waiting for the session end. In statement or transaction
      pooling mode, this has no effect since that is the default behavior
      there.

      If because of this setting a server connection is closed before the end
      of the client session, the client connection is also closed. This ensures
      that the client notices that the session has been interrupted.

      This setting makes connection configuration changes take effect sooner if
      session pooling and long-running sessions are used. The downside is that
      client sessions  are liable to be interrupted by a configuration change,
      so client applications will need logic to reconnect and reestablish
      session state. But note that no transactions will be lost, because
      running transactions are not interrupted, only idle sessions.

  server_login_retry:
    default: 15.0

      During the waiting interval, new clients trying to connect to the failing
      server will get an error immediately without another connection attempt.
      [seconds]

      The purpose of this behavior is that clients don’t unnecessarily queue
      up waiting for a server connection to become available if the server is
      not working. However, it also means that if a server is momentarily
      failing, for example during a restart or if the configuration was
      erroneous, then it will take at least this long until the pooler will
      consider connecting to it again. Planned events such as restarts should
      normally be managed using the PAUSE command to avoid this.

  dns_zone_check_period:

    description: |
      Period to check if a zone serial has changed.

      PgBouncer can collect DNS zones from host names (everything after first
      dot) and then periodically check if the zone serial changes. If it
      notices changes, all host names under that zone are looked up again. If
      any host IP changes, its connections are invalidated.
